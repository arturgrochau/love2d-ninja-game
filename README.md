# NinjaCut

A side-scrolling action game originally developed in 2020 at [PUC-Rio](https://www.puc-rio.br/) (Pontifícia Universidade Católica do Rio de Janeiro), the same university responsible for the creation of the Lua programming language. This project was led by [@slenderks](https://github.com/slenderks) and includes contributions from multiple students, including [@arturpedrotti](https://github.com/arturpedrotti).
